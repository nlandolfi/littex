          (undefined) concept, is that of ‹belonging›. ⦉

        ‖ This version of the Greek letter epsilon is so often
          used to denote belonging that its use to denote
          anything else is almost prohibited. ⦉

        ‖ Most authors relegate $ϵ$ to its set-theoretic use
          forever and use $ε$ when they need the fifth letter of
