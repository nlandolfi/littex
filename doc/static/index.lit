          used to denote belonging that its use to denote

          forever and use $ε$ when they need the fifth letter of
          the Greek alphabet. ⦉

      ¶ ⦊
        ‖ It happens that all circulant matrices have the same
          eigenvectors. ⦉

        ‖ Recall that if $C$ is circulant then
          ◇ ⦊

          if it is one of $S$.
